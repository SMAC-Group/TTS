In this chapter we introduce a class of time series models that is flexible and
among the most commonly used to describe stationary time series. This class is 
represented by the AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models which combine and
include the AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models seen in the
previous chapter. We first discuss AR and MA models in further detail before
introducing the general ARMA class. The importance of the latter class of models
resides in its flexibility as well as its capacity of describing (or closely
approximating) the features of stationary time series. The autoregressive parts
of these models describe how consecutive observations in time influence each
other while the moving average parts capture some possible unobserved shocks
thereby allowing to model different phenomena going from biology to finance.

To introduce and explain this class of models, this chapter is organized in the
following manner. First of all we will discuss the class of linear processes of
which the ARMA models are part of. We will then proceed to a detailed
description of AR models in which we review their definition, explain their
properties, introduce the main estimation methods for their parameters and
highlight the diagnostic tools which can help understand if the estimated models
appear to be appropriate or sufficient to well describe the observed time series.
Once this is done, we will then use most of the results given for AR models to 
further describe and discuss MA models, for which we underline the property of
invertibility, and finally the ARMA models. Indeed, the properties and
estimation methods for the latter class are directly inherited from the
discussions on AR and MA models.

## Linear Operators and Processes

Within this section, the concepts of linear operators and processes will be
discussed thereby providing some theoretical bases to model a variety of time series data.
In fact, every time series that is weakly stationary is either a 
linear process or can be redefined as such after being transformed using a linear 
operation such as, for example, removing a trend through differencing. 

### Linear Operators

Prior to introducing linear processes, we will first discuss the concept of linear operators that are necessary to better understand the former. These operators allow to manipulate time series in order to transform them into a form that can be represented by the models presented in the previous chapters (and the ARMA models presented further on). Generally speaking, these operators serve three main goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item converting a time series into a linear process form;
  \item differencing in order to remove deterministic components;
  \item removing seasonal trends.
\end{itemize}

```{definition, label="linop", name = "Linear Operator"}
A linear operator $L$ is an operator that satisfies the following two 
conditions: 

\[\begin{aligned}
  L\left( {{X_t} + {Y_t}} \right) &= L{X_t} + L{X_t} & \text{(Preserves Addition)}\\
  L\left( {\lambda  \cdot {X_t}} \right) &= \lambda  \cdot \left( {L{X_t}} \right) & \text{(Preserves Scalar Multiplication)} \\ 
\end{aligned} \]
```

Given these definitions, the following subsections will investigate some specific linear operators that are particularly suited to manipulate the time series that are treated within this chapter.

#### Backshift (Lag) Operator

The backshift operator is a linear operator which can be used to define the other operators that will be discussed in the following paragraphs. The purpose of this operator is to change the
indices of the time series by one period (e.g. $t \rightarrow t-1$) thereby shifting a variable at time $t$ to its predecessor at time $t-1$. 

```{definition, label="backshiftop", name = "Backshift Operator"}
The backshift operator $B$ is defined as:

\[B{X_t} = {X_{t - 1}}\]
```

Given this definition, the backshift operator has the following properties:

1. ${B^k}{X_t} = B^{k-1} B {X_t} = B^{k-1} {X_{t-1}} = ... = {X_{t - k}}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$
2. $B^{u} = {X_{t+u}}$ for $u \in \mathbb{Z}^{-}$ (i.e. negative integer powers)
3. $Bc = c$ for $c \in \real$
4. $B^0 = 1$

Often the backshift operator may be denoted as $L$ which can be confused with the notation of the linear operator provided earlier. Therefore, in the context of this chapter (and book), please notice that $L$ will denote a general linear operator and that $B$ will instead denote the backshift operator.

```{example, label="backshiftseasons", name = "Backshift operator for seasonality"}
A certain power used for the backshift operator can be useful to deal with seasonal features in the observed time series. For example, in the case of 
monthly data, $B^{12} X_t = X_{t-12}$ would eventually allow to deal with cycles that occur every year while $B^{3} X_t = X_{t-3}$ would be more adapted to dealing with quarterly characteristics.
```

#### Difference Operator

A very useful operator that can be defined through the backshift operator $B$ is given by the difference operator $\nabla$. The latter is particularly helpful when there is a need to remove trends from the time series.

```{definition, label="diffop", name = "Difference Operator"}
The **Difference Operator** is defined as follows:

\[\nabla {X_t} = \left( {1 - B} \right){X_t} = {X_t} - {X_{t - 1}}.\]

The difference operator has the following properties:

1. ${\nabla ^k}{X_t} = {\nabla ^{k - 1}} \left( {\nabla {X_t}}\right) = \left( {1 - B} \right)^k {X_t}$
2. $\nabla c = 0$ for $c \in \real$
3. ${\nabla ^0}{X_t} = {X_t}$

```

```{example, label="diffex", name = "Repetitive Differencing"}
To understand the repetitive nature of the difference operator, consider the
case when the number of differences is $k = 2$:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {\nabla ^2}{X_t} &= \nabla \left( {\nabla {X_t}} \right) \\
   &= \nabla \left( {{X_t} - {X_{t - 1}}} \right) = \nabla {X_t} - \nabla {X_{t - 1}} \\
   &= \left( {{X_t} - {X_{t - 1}}} \right) - \left( {{X_{t - 1}} - {X_{t - 2}}} \right) \\
   &= {X_t} - 2{X_{t - 1}} + {X_{t - 2}} \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

Notice that at the end of the process, we are able to re-express the
differencing operation in terms of the backshift operator:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {\nabla ^2}{X_t} &= {X_t} - 2{X_{t - 1}} + {X_{t - 2}} = {X_t} - 2B{X_t} + B^2{X_t} \\
   &= \left( {1 - B} \right)\left( {1 - B} \right){X_t} = {\left( {1 - B} \right)^2}{X_t} \\ 
\end{aligned} \]
```

#### Seasonal Difference Operator

A specific case of the backshift operator, as highlighted earlier, is the capacity of adapting to seasonal features in the time series. Indeed, there may be trends in the time series that occur over lags of months or even years. In order to remove these trends in the process, a seasonal version of the difference operator can therefore be used.

```{definition, label="seasonaldiff", name = "Seasonal Difference Operator"}
The seasonal difference operator can applied by using a seasonal backshift:

\[{\nabla _s}{X_t} = \left( {1 - B_s} \right){X_t} = {X_t} - {X_{t - s}} \]

where $s$ denotes the lag at which the seasonal trend occurs. Being a specific case of the difference operator, the previously discussed
properties associated with the difference operator generally hold. However, the seasonal difference operator is more specifically represented as follows:

\[{\nabla ^k_s}{X_t} = {\left( {1 - B_s} \right)^k}{X_t},\]

and therefore can be more complex to apply than a simple difference operator.

```


### Linear Processes

The stationary models considered so far, including the ARMA models treated further on in this chapter, can all be represented as linear processes. Indeed, a linear process is a process that can be represented as an infinite linear combination of independent random variables $\left\{W_t\right\}$ with linear coefficients generally denoted as $\psi_j$, $j = -\infty,...,+\infty$. The following figure gives a general idea of how a linear process can be obtained.

```{r linearfilter, fig.cap="Linear process representation", cache = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter/filtering.png")
```

To put this definition into context, recall Example \@ref(ex:exar1) where *backsubstitution* was used to represent an AR(1) model as a linear combination of a white noise process $\left\{W_t\right\}$. Using the *backshift* operator $B$ defined earlier, we can revisit this example in the following manner:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {X_t} &= \phi {X_{t - 1}} + {W_t} \\
  {X_t} - \phi {X_{t - 1}} &= {W_t} \\
  \left( {1 - \phi B} \right){X_t} &= {W_t} \\
  {X_t} &= \frac{1}{{1 - \phi B}}{W_t} \\
   &= \sum\limits_{j = 0}^\infty  {{\phi ^j}{B^j}{W_t}}  = \sum\limits_{j = 0}^\infty  {{\phi ^j}{W_{t - j}}} . \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

As can be seen, under the condition that $\left|\phi\right| < 1$, an AR(1) can therefore be represented as a linear process. Given the above discussion and examples, let us now formalize the definition of this class of processes.

```{definition, label="lp", name="Linear Process"}
A time series $\left\{X_t\right\}$ is defined to be a linear process if it can be expressed
as a linear combination of white noise by:

\[{X_t} = \mu + \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{W_{t - j}}} \]

where $W_t \sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {{\psi _j}} \right|}  < \infty$.
```

Note, the latter assumption (i.e. $\sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {{\psi _j}} \right|}  < \infty$) is required to ensure that the series has a limit. Hence, the set of coefficients \[{\{ {\psi _j}\} _{j =  - \infty , \cdots ,\infty }}\]
can be viewed as linear filter that do not have to be all equal
nor symmetric as later examples will show. 

```{theorem, label="lpstat", name="Stationarity of Linear Process"}
A linear process $\left\{X_t\right\}$ in the form of Definition \@ref(def:lp) 
is stationary with:

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[X_t] &= \mu \\
\gamma(h) &= \sigma^2\sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{\psi _{h + j}}}.
\end{aligned}\]
```

```{proof}
Given that the
series converges under $\sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {{\psi _j}} \right|}  < \infty$, the expectation and autocovariance can be computed in a straightforward manner. Indeed, for the expectation we have:

\[E\left[ {{X_t}} \right] = E\left[ {\mu  + \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{W_{t - j}}} } \right] = \mu  + \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}E\left[ {{W_{t - j}}} \right]}  = \mu  + 0 = \mu \]

As for the autocovariance, noting that $\cov\left( {{W_{t + h - j}},{W_{t - i}}} \right) = 0$ for $i \ne j + h$, we have:

\[\begin{aligned}
  \cov \left( {{X_{t + h}},{X_t}} \right) &= \cov \left( {\mu  + \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{W_{t + h - j}}} ,\mu  + \sum\limits_{i =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _i}{W_{t - i}}} } \right) \\
   &= \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {\sum\limits_{i =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{\psi _i}\cov \left( {{W_{t + h - j}},{W_{t - i}}} \right)} }  = \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _{j + h}}{\psi _j}\cov \left( {{W_t},{W_t}} \right)}  + \sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {\sum\limits_{i =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{\psi _i}\underbrace {\cov \left( {{W_{t + h - j}},{W_{t - i}}} \right)}_{ = 0}} }  \\
   &= \sigma _W^2\sum\limits_{j =  - \infty }^\infty  {{\psi _j}{\psi _i}}.  \\ 
\end{aligned} \]
```

```{example, label="backshiftlp", name = "Backshift operators for Linear Processes"}
A special notation for linear processes based on the backshift operator is as follows:

\[\begin{aligned}
  {X_t} &= \mu  + \psi \left( B \right){W_t} \\
  \psi \left( B \right) &= \sum\limits_{j = 0}^\infty  {{\psi _j}{B^j}}  \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

This notation allows to define the processes in a more compact form.
```

### Examples of Linear Processes

Let us now consider how to represent the time series models discussed in
Section \@ref(basicmodels) as a linear process. Generally speaking, the work required to transform the traditional representation of a time series model into the form of a linear process consists mainly in finding the set of corresponding linear coefficients $\psi_j$ highlighted earlier.

```{example, label="lpwn", name="White Noise"}

The representation of white noise process $\left\{X_t\right\}$, defined in \@ref(wn), as a linear process is quite straighforward since we have that:

\[\psi _j = \begin{cases}
      1 , &\mbox{ if } j = 0\\
      0 , &\mbox{ if } |j| \ge 1,
\end{cases}\]

and $\mu = 0$. Indeed, $X_t = W_t$ with $W_t \sim WN(0, \sigma^2_W)$, and therefore $\psi_0 = 1$ while the other coefficients are zero.
```

```{example, label="lpma1", name="First Order Moving Average"}

Consider the MA(1) process $\left\{X_t\right\}$ defined in \@ref(ma1). The representation of this process as a linear process can be done when defining the coefficients $\psi_j$ as follows: 

\[\psi _j = \begin{cases}
      1, &\mbox{ if } j = 0\\
      \theta , &\mbox{ if } j = 1 \\
      0, &\mbox{ if } j \ge 2,
\end{cases}\]

and $\mu = 0$. Also in this case, as for the white noise process, the linear representation is directly observable from the traditional representation of the MA(1) process given by $X_t = W_t + \theta W_{t-1}$. It is in fact easy to see that $\psi_0 = 1$, $\psi_1 = \theta$ and the others are zero.
```

```{example, label="lpsma", name="Symmetric Moving Average"}

Similarly to the MA(1) process, let us define a symmetric moving average which is given by:

\[{X_t} = \frac{1}{{2q + 1}}\sum\limits_{j =  - q}^q {{W_{t + j}}} \]

The process $\left\{X_t\right\}$ is therefore defined for $q + 1 \le t \le n-q$ and can also be represented as a linear process since:

\[\psi _j = \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{{2q + 1}} , &\mbox{ if } -q \le j \le q\\
      0 , &\mbox{ if } |j| > q.
\end{cases}\]

and $\mu = 0$.
```


```{example, label="lpar1", name="First Order Autoregressive Process"}
A slightly less intuitive approach would be to represent an AR(1) process as a linear process. To do so, let $\left\{X_t\right\}$ in this case represent an AR(1) process, defined in \@ref(ar1) as being $X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + W_t$, with $\left| \phi \right| < 1$. If we use a first-step backsubsitution, from this we obtain that $X_t = \phi^2 X_{t-2} + \phi W_{t-1} + W_t$ and, by doing so recursively and using convergence results based on the value of $\phi$, this process can indeed be represented as a linear process by defining the coefficients $\psi_j$ as:

\[\psi _j = \begin{cases}
      \phi^j , &\mbox{ if } j \ge 0\\
      0 , &\mbox{ if } j < 0.
\end{cases}\]

```

## Autoregressive Models

The class of autoregressive models is based on the idea that previous values in the time series are needed to explain current values in the series. For this class of models, we assume that the $p$ previous observations are needed for this purpose and we therefore denote this class as AR($p$). In the previous  chapter, the model we introduced was an AR(1) in which only the immediately previous observation is needed to explain the following one and therefore represents a particular model which is part of the more general class of AR(p) models.

```{definition, label="arp", name = "Autoregressive Models of Order $p$"}
The AR(p) models can be formally represented as follows
$${X_t} = {\phi_1}{X_{t - 1}} + ... + {\phi_p}{X_{t - p}} + {W_t},$$
where $\phi_j \neq 0$, for $j=1,...,p$, and $W_t$ is a (Gaussian) white noise process with
variance $\sigma^2$. 
```

In general, we will assume that the expectation of the process $({X_t})$, as well as that of the following ones in this chapter, is zero. The reason for this simplification is that if $\mathbb{E} [ X_t ] = \mu$, we can define an AR(p) process *around* $\mu$ as follows:

$$X_t - \mu = \sum_{i = 1}^p \phi_i \left(X_{t-i} - \mu \right) + W_t,$$

which is equivalent to 

$$X_t  = \mu^{\star} +  \sum_{i = 1}^p \phi_i X_{t-i}  + W_t,$$

where $\mu^{\star} = \mu (1 - \sum_{i = 1}^p \phi_i)$. Therefore, to simplify the notation we will generally consider only zero mean processes, since adding means (as well as other deterministic trends) is easy.

A useful way of representing AR(p) processes is through the backshift operator introduced in the previous section and is as follows

\[\begin{aligned}
  {X_t} &= {\phi_1}{X_{t - 1}} + ... + {\phi_p}{y_{t - p}} + {w_t} \\
   &= {\phi_1}B{X_t} + ... + {\phi_p}B^p{X_t} + {W_t} \\
   &= ({\phi_1}B + ... + {\phi_p}B^p){X_t} + {W_t} \\ 
\end{aligned},\]

which finally yields

$$(1 - {\phi _1}B - ... - {\phi_p}B^p){X_t} = {W_t},$$

or, in abbreviated form, can be expressed as

$$\phi(B){X_t} = W_t.$$

We will see that $\phi(B)$ is important to establish the stationarity of
these processes and is called the *autoregressive* operator. Moreover, this
quantity is closely related to another important property of AR(p) processes called *causality*. Before formally defining this new property, we consider the following example, which provides an intuitive illustration of its importance.

```{example, label="ncAR1", name="Non-causal AR(1)"}
Consider a classical AR(1) model with $|\phi| > 1$. Such a model could be
expressed as

$$X_t = \phi^{-1} X_{t+1} - \phi^{-1} W_{t+1} = \phi^{-k} X_{t+k} - \sum_{i = 1}^{k-1} \phi^{-i} W_{t+i}.$$

Since $|\phi| > 1$, we obtain

$$X_t = - \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} \phi^{-j} W_{t-j},$$

which is a linear process and therefore is stationary. Unfortunately, such
a model is useless because we need the future to predict the future itself and these processes are therefore called non-causal.
```

### Properties of AR(p) models

In this section we discuss the main properties of AR(p) processes. We first consider the causality of these models which has already been introduced in the previous paragraphs and then discuss the autocorrelation (and partial autocorrelation) of AR(p) models. 

#### Causality

In the previous section we already introduced the idea of a causal time series model and therefore let us now introduce this concept in a more formal manner.

```{definition, label="causalar", name = "Causality of AR(p) models"}
 An AR(p) model is said to be *causal* if the time series $(X_t)$ can be
 written as a one-sided linear process:
 
$$X_t = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \psi_j W_{t-j} = \frac{1}{\phi(B)} W_t = \psi(B) W_t,$$

where $\phi(B) = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \phi_j B^j$, $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}|\phi_j| < \infty$ and $\phi_0 = 1$.
```

As discussed earlier this condition implies that only the past values of the time series can explain the future values of it, and not vice versa. Moreover, in the previous section we saw that linear processes are (weakly) stationary processes and therefore causality directly implies (weak) stationarity. However, it might be difficult and not obvious to show the causality of  AR(p) processes by using the above definitions directly, thus the following property is particularly useful in practice. 

```{theorem, label="theocausalar", name = "Causality of AR models"}
An AR(p) model is causal if and only if $\phi(z) \neq 0$ for $|z| \leq 1$.
Then, the coefficients of the one-sided linear process given in
\@ref(def:causalar) can be obtained by solving
\begin{equation*}
    \psi(z) = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \phi_j z^j} = \frac{1}{\phi(z)}, \mbox{ } |z| \leq 1.
\end{equation*}
```

The proof of this result is omitted but can (for example) be found in Appendix B of @shumway2010time. Moreover, it can be seen how there is no solution to the above equation if $\phi(z) = 0$ for $|z| \leq 1$ and therefore, as highlighted earlier, an AR(p) is causal if and only if $\phi(z) \neq 0$ for $|z| \leq 1$. A condition for this to be respected is for the roots of $\phi(z) = 0$ to lie *outside the unit circle*.

Before further discussing the properties of AR(p) models we consider the following two examples which discuss the causality (and stationarity) of AR(2) models.

```{example, label="ex1causality", name = "Transforming an AR(2) into a linear process"}

Given the following AR(2) $X_t = 1.3X_{t-1} - 0.4X_{t-2} + W_t$ one could
wonder if this process can be written as a one-sided linear process as in
Definition \@ref(def:causalar). This can be done using the following approach:

*Step 1:* The autoregressive operator of this model can be expressed as:

\[\phi(z) = 1 - 1.3z + 0.4z^2 = (1 - 0.5z)(1 - 0.8z) ,\]

and has roots $2 > 1$ and $1.25 > 1$. Thus, we should be able to covert it
into linear process.


*Step 2:* From Theorem \@ref(thm:theocausalar) we know that if an AR(p) process has all its roots outside the unit circle, we can write $X_t = \phi^{-1}(B)W_t$ and "inverse" the autoregressive operator $\phi(B)$ as follows:

\[\phi^{-1}(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.5z)(1 - 0.8z)} = \frac{c_1}{(1 - 0.5z)} + \frac{c_2}{(1 - 0.8z)} = \frac{c_2(1 - 0.5z) + c_1(1 - 0.8z)}{(1 - 0.5z)(1 - 0.8z)} .\]

Since we can think of the above equation as valid for any $z$, we will solve  the following system of equations to get $c_1$ and $c_2$,

\[\begin{cases}
        c_1 + c_2 &= 1\\
        -0.5 c_2 - 0.8 c_1 &= 0
\end{cases}
\implies 
\begin{cases}
        c_1 &= -\frac{5}{3}\\
        c_2 &= \frac{8}{3},
\end{cases}
\]

and, we obtain

\[\phi^{-1}(z) = \frac{-5}{3(1 - 0.5z)} + \frac{8}{3(1 - 0.8z)} .\]

*Step 3:* Using the Geometric series, i.e. 
$a \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}r^k = \frac{a}{1-r}, \mbox{ if } |r| < 1$, we have

\[\begin{cases}
      \frac{-5}{3(1 - 0.5z)} &= \frac{-5}{3} \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}0.5^jz^j , \mbox{ if } |z| < 2\\
      \frac{8}{3(1 - 0.8z)} &= \frac{8}{3} \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}0.8^jz^j , \mbox{ if } |z| < 1.25.
\end{cases}\]

This allows to express $\phi^{-1}(z)$ as

\[\phi^{-1}(z) = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \left[ \frac{-5}{3} (0.5)^j + \frac{8}{3} (0.8)^j \right] z^j, \mbox{ if } |z| < 1.25 .\]

*Step 4:* Finally, we obtain
\[X_t = \phi^{-1}(B)W_t = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \left[ \frac{-5}{3} (0.5)^j + \frac{8}{3} (0.8)^j \right] B^j W_t = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \left[ \frac{-5}{3} (0.5)^j + \frac{8}{3} (0.8)^j \right] W_{t-j},
\]
which verifies that the AR(2) is causal (and stationary).
```

```{example, label="ex2causality", name = "Causal conditions for an AR(2) processes"}
We already know that an AR(1) is causal with the simple condition $|\phi_1| < 1$. It could seem natural to believe that an AR(2) should be causal (and therefore stationary) with the conditon: $|\phi_i| < 1, \, i = 1,2$. However, this is not the case since an AR(2) can be expressed as

\[X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + W_t = \phi_1 B X_t + \phi_2 B^2 X_t + W_t,\]

thereby delivering the following autoregressive operator:

\[\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2.\]

Therefore, the process is causal when the roots of $\phi(z)$ lie outside the unit circle. Letting $z_1$ and $z_2$ denote those roots, we impose the following constraints to ensure the causality of the model:

\[\begin{aligned}
|z_1| &> 1, \;\;\;\; \text{where} \;\; &z_1 = \frac{\phi_1 + \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}}{-2 \phi_2},\\
|z_2| &> 1, \;\;\;\; \text{where} \;\; &z_2 = \frac{\phi_1 - \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}}{-2 \phi_2},
\end{aligned}\]
noting that $z_1$ and $z_2$ can be complex values.

Thus we can represent $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ by $z_1$ and $z_2$,
\[\begin{aligned}
\phi_1 = (z_1^{-1} + z_2^{-1}),\\
\phi_2 = -(z_1 z_2)^{-1}.
\end{aligned}\]

Moreover we have the following equivalent condition for causality:

$$\begin{cases}
        |z_1| &> 1\\
        |z_2| &> 1,
\end{cases}$$
if and only if
$$\begin{cases}
        \phi_1 + \phi_2 &< 1\\
        \phi_2 - \phi_1 &< 1\\
        |\phi_2| &< 1.
\end{cases}$$

We can show the "*if*" part of the statement as follows

$\phi_1 + \phi_2 = \frac{1}{z_1} + \frac{1}{z_2} - \frac{1}{z_1z_2} = \frac{1}{z_1}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{z_2} \right) + \frac{1}{z_2} < 1 - \frac{1}{z_2} + \frac{1}{z_2} = 1$, (since $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{z_2} \right) > 0$)

$\phi_2 - \phi_1 = - \frac{1}{z_1z_2} - \frac{1}{z_1} - \frac{1}{z_2} = - \frac{1}{z_1}\left( \frac{1}{z_2} + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{z_2} < \frac{1}{z_2} + 1 - \frac{1}{z_2} = 1$, (since $\left( \frac{1}{z_2} + 1 \right) > 0$)

$|\phi_2| = \frac{1}{|z_1||z_2|} < 1$.

We can also show "*only if*" part of the statement below

Since $z_1 = \frac{\phi_1 + \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}}{-2 \phi_2}$ and $\phi_2-1 < \phi_1 < 1-\phi_2$, then $z_1^2 = \frac{\left(\phi_1 + \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}\right)^2}{4 \phi_2^2} < \frac{\left((1-\phi_2) + \sqrt{(1-\phi_2)^2 + 4\phi_2}\right)^2}{4 \phi_2^2} = \frac{4}{4 \phi_2^2} \leq 1$.

Since $z_2 = \frac{\phi_1 - \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}}{-2 \phi_2}$ and $\phi_2-1 < \phi_1 < 1-\phi_2$, then $z_2^2 = \frac{\left(\phi_1 - \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}\right)^2}{4 \phi_2^2} < \frac{\left((\phi_2-1) + \sqrt{(\phi_2-1)^2 + 4\phi_2}\right)^2}{4 \phi_2^2} = \frac{4 \phi_2^2}{4 \phi_2^2} = 1$.

#### Autocorrelation

In this section we discuss the autocorrelation of (causal) AR(p) processes. Before considering the general case of an AR(p) model, we revisit Example \@ref(ex:ex1causality) and derive the ACF of the AR(2) model presented in this example.

```{example, label="ar2acf", name = "Autocorrelation of an AR(2)"}
Considering the same model as in Example \@ref(ex:ex1causality), i.e.
$X_t = 1.3X_{t-1} - 0.4X_{t-2} + W_t$, we can derive the ACF using the
following steps: 

*Step 1:* Find the homogeneous difference equation with respect to the ACF 
$\rho(h)$, which in this case is given by:
\[\rho(h) - 1.3\rho(h-1) + 0.4\rho(h-2) = 0, \mbox{   } h = 1,2,...\]
and the initial conditions are $\rho(0) = 1$ and $\rho(-1) = \frac{13}{14}$.
Note that the above equation is a homogenous difference equation of order 2.

*Step 2:* Using the results of Example \@ref(ex:ex1causality), we have:
\[\phi(z) = 1 - 1.3z + 0.4z^2 = (1 - 0.5z)(1 - 0.8z) ,\]
and the roots of this equation are given by $z_1 = 2 > 1$ and $z_2 = 1.25 > 1$.
Moreover, since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are real and distinct, and since they correspond to the solution of a homogenous difference equation of order 2, we obtain:

\[\rho(h) = c_1 z_1^{-h} + c_2 z_2^{-h}.\]

*Step 3:* Solve $c_1$ and $c_2$ based on the two initial conditions found in Step 1, i.e.
\[\begin{cases}
      \rho(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1\\
      \rho(-1) = 2c_1 + 1.25c_2 = \frac{13}{14},
\end{cases},\]
implying that $c_1 = -\frac{3}{7}$ and $c_2 = \frac{10}{7}$. The ACF for this model is therefore given by
\[\rho(h) = -\frac{3}{7}2^{-h} + \frac{10}{7}\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{-h} ,\]
which is represented in the plot below.
```

```{r ACFAR2cont, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Theoretical ACF of the AR(2) Process."}
```

The method used in the previous paragraphs is only applicable for AR(2) models with roots that are distinct and real, which is true when $\phi_2 > - \phi^1/4$. In the case where $\phi_2 = - \phi^1/4$, the autoregressive operator has a single root and $\rho(h)$ can be obtained by determining (using initial conditions) the constants $c_1$ and  $c_2$ of the following expression:

$$\rho(h) = z_1^{-h} \left(c_1 + c_2 h\right).$$
When $\phi_2 > - \phi^1/4$ the roots are complex conjugate pairs and the solution is given by:

$$\rho(h) = c_1 |z_1|^{-h} \cos \left(h \theta + c_2\right), $$
where the constants depend on initial conditions, while $\theta = \text{arg}(z_1)$. 

Therefore, we have that $\rho(h) \to 0$ exponentially fast as $h \to \infty$ and when $\phi_2 > - \phi^1/4$ $\rho(h)$ it goes to zero in a sinusoidal fashion. This behavior is illustrated in the next example.

```{example, label="ar2acfExample", name = "Autocorrelation of AR(2) Processes"}
Consider the following models:

\[\begin{aligned}
  \text{Model 1}: \;\;\; X_t &= X_{t-1} - 0.25 X_{t-2} + W_t  \\
  \text{Model 2}: \;\;\; X_t &= 0.5 X_{t-1} + 0.25 X_{t-2} + W_t  \\
  \text{Model 3}: \;\;\; X_t &= -1.5 X_{t-1} - 0.75 X_{t-2} + W_t.
\end{aligned} \]

It is easy to verify that the first one has real distrinct roots, the second has a unique real root while the last has complex roots. This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:causalAR2part2) which depicts the causal region of an AR(2) that has been separated between models with real and complex roots.
```

The ACF of these models are represented in Figure \@ref(fig:ACFAR2eg). As expected the 
three models correspond to an ACF that dampens exponentially fast but only 
Model 3 exhibits a sinusoidal features.

```{r ACFAR2eg, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Theoretical Autocorrelation Graphs with models from left to right being Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3."}
```


Next, we consider the ACF for a general causal AR($p$) model. Unfortunately, this is far more complicated than our previous example.

```{r causalAR2part2, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Viable Solutions of AR(p)"}
```

```{example, label="arpacf", name = "Autocorrelation of an AR($p$)"}

Recall that the AR($p$) models can formally be represented as follows
$${X_t} = {\phi_1}{X_{t - 1}} + ... + {\phi_p}{X_{t - p}} + {W_t},$$
where $W_t$ is a (Gaussian) white noise process with variance $\sigma^2$.

There are two ways to derive the ACF for general AR($p$) models. Considering the first approach, since we assume our AR($p$) model is causal, we can write it as a one-sided linear process: $X_t = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \psi_j W_{t-j}$ which defines the autocovariance function as $\gamma(h) = cov(X_{t+h},X_t) = \sigma^2 \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \psi_j \psi_{j+h}$, for $h \geq 0$. The difficulty of this method is to solve for the $\psi$-weights. Treating the AR(p) as a special case of ARMA(p,q) models, we can let the MA polynomials $\theta(z) = 1$ and solve the $\psi$-weights by matching the coefficients in $\phi(z)\psi(z) = \theta(z)$. 

Considering now the second method, we can also use the procedure we used for the AR(2) example. This consists in finding a homogeneous difference equation with respect to the ACF $\rho(h)$ thereby solving it directly. To do so we need following steps.

*Step 1*: Find the homogeneous difference equation with repsect to the ACF $\rho(h)$.

Firstly verify whether our model is causal. If it is then we have
\[\rho(h) - \phi_1\rho(h-1) - \cdots - \phi_p\rho(h-p) = 0, \mbox{ } h \geq p. \]

*Step 2*: Solve the roots of the associated AR polynomials.

The polynomials can be written as:
\[\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1z - \cdots - \phi_pz^p .\]

Let us suppose now that the polynomials have $r$ distinct roots and let $m_j$ denote the number of replicates of $z_j$, such that $m_1 +m_2 + \cdots +m_r = p$. Then the general solution of the homogeneous difference equation is 
\[\rho(h) = z_1^{-h}P_1(h) + z_2^{-h}P_2(h) + \cdots + z_r^{-h}P_r(h), \mbox{ } h \geq p,\]
where $P_j(h)$ is the polynomial in $h$ of degree $m_j - 1$.

*Step 3*: Solve every $P_j(h)$ based on $p$ given initial conditions on $\rho(h)$.

**Remark:**
Since the AR($p$) model is causal, the roots we obtained in step 2 should be outside the unit circle (i.e. $|z_i| > 1$, for $i = 1, \cdots, r$). Then the absolute value of the general solution is given by
\[|\rho(h)| = \left|\frac{P_1(h)}{z_1^{h}} + \frac{P_2(h)}{z_2^{h}} + \cdots + \frac{P_r(h)}{z_r^{h}}\right| \leq \left|\frac{P_1(h)}{z_1^{h}}\right| + \left| \frac{P_2(h)}{z_2^{h}}\right| + \dots + \left|\frac{P_r(h)}{z_r^{h}}\right| \leq \frac{r \left|P_r(h)\right|}{\min_{j = 1, \dots, r} \left|z_j \right|^{h}},\]

and, from the right hand side of the last inequality, we can find that the rate of convergence would be dominated by $\frac{1}{\min_{j = 1, \dots, r} \left|z_j \right|^{h}}$.
Thus the ACF $\rho(h)$ will go to zero exponentially as $h \to \infty$.
```

EXAMPLE MISSING HERE 

The ACF can overall be extremely useful in detecting if there appears to be an autocorrelation pattern in the data where, as seen above, an exponentially or sinusoidally decaying ACF would suggest the presence of an AR(p) process generating the time series. However, these patterns can appear to be very similar even for AR(p) models with considerably different orders (i.e. an AR(1) or and AR(3) for example). In this sense, the ACF has limited utility if there is a need to detect the order of the underlying AR(p) process. For this reason, the next section will discuss another representation of a time series which can be of more help in detecting, for example, the order of an AR(p) model.

#### Partial autocorrelation of AR(p) models

```{definition, label="pacf", name = "Partial autocorrelation"}
For a stationary process, $X_t$, the Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF)
can be denoted as $\phi_{hh}$, for $h = 1, 2, \dots,$ where
$$\phi_{11} = \corr(X_{t+1}, X_t) = \rho(1),$$
and 
$$\phi_{hh} = \corr(X_{t+h} - \hat{X}_{t+h}, X_t - \hat{X}_t), \mbox{ } h \geq 2.$$
```

**Remark**
From the above definition we can think of the partial autocorrelation $\phi_{hh}$ as the correlation between the residual of $X_{t+h}$ after removing its best linear predictor on the vector space spanned by $\{ X_{t+1}, \dots, X_{t+h-1} \}$ and the residual of $X_t$ after removing its best linear predictor on the same vector space. Similarly to linear regression, the residuals should be independent of the vector space spanned by $\{ X_{t+1}, \dots, X_{t+h-1} \}$ after projection. 

We will discuss about the best linear predictor in the section dedicated to forecasting and therefore here we will just mention how to obtain the best linear predictor. Given a time series $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_t$ with zero mean, the best linear predictor of $X_{t+h}$ can be written as $\hat{X}_{t+h} = \sum_{j=1}^t \alpha_j X_j$ such that it satisfies the prediction equations:
\[ \mathbb{E}(X_{t+h} - \hat{X}_{t+h}) = 0, \]
and
\[ \mathbb{E} [(X_{t+h} - \hat{X}_{t+h})X_j ] = 0, \mbox{ for } i = 1, \dots, t.\]
According to the projection theorem, we can show that satisfying the prediction equations is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error $\mathbb{E}((X_{t+h} - \hat{X}_{t+h})^2)$.
Thus we have two equivalent ways to obtain the best linear predictor.

```{example, label="pacfar1", name = "PACF of an AR(1)"}
Consider a causal AR(1) model ${X_t} = \phi {X_{t - 1}} + {W_t}$. We have, 
\[\phi_{11} = \corr(X_{t+1}, X_t) = \rho(1) = \phi,\]
and 
\[\phi_{22} = \corr(X_{t+2} - \hat{X}_{t+2}, X_t - \hat{X}_t).\]
Next, we find $\hat{X}_t$ and $\hat{X}_{t+2}$. Since $X_{t+1}$ is the only
random variavle between $X_t$ and $X_{t+2}$, $\hat{X}_t$ and $\hat{X}_{t+2}$ are the best linear predictors on the vector space spanned by $X_t$ and we can obtain them by minimizing the MSE: 
\[\mathbb{E}(X_{t+2} - \hat{X}_{t+2})^2 = \mathbb{E}(X_{t+2} - \beta_1 X_{t+1})^2 = \gamma(0) - 2\beta_1 \gamma(1) + \beta_1^2 \gamma(0),\]
By minimizing the MSE, we have $\beta_1 = \frac{\gamma(1)}{\gamma(0)} = \phi$.

Similarily, by minimizing
\[\mathbb{E}(X_{t} - \hat{X}_{t})^2 = \mathbb{E}(X_{t} - \beta_2 X_{t+1})^2 = \gamma(0) - 2\beta_2 \gamma(1) + \beta_2^2 \gamma(0),\]
we have $\beta_2 = \frac{\gamma(1)}{\gamma(0)} = \phi$.

Equivalently we can use the prediction equations and thus we have
\[\mathbb{E}[(X_{t+2} - \hat{X}_{t+2})X_{t+1}] = \mathbb{E}[(X_{t+2}X_{t+1} - \beta_1 X_{t+1}^2)] = \gamma(1) - \beta_1 \gamma(0) = 0,\]
and
\[\mathbb{E}[(X_{t} - \hat{X}_{t})X_{t+1}] = \mathbb{E}[(X_{t}X_{t+1} - \beta_2 X_{t+1}^2)] = \gamma(1) - \beta_2 \gamma(0) = 0,\]
Consequently we can get the same solutions.

Therefore, \[\phi_{22} = \corr(X_{t+2} - \phi X_{t+1}, X_t - \phi X_{t+1}) = \corr(W_{t+2}, X_t - \phi X_{t+1}) = 0,\]
noting that the last equation is based on causality.
```

```{example, label="pacfarp", name = "PACF of AR(p)"}
In this example we would like to show that the PACF characterizes the order of AR(p) models. Indeed, when $h > p$, the PACF of an AR(p) $\phi_{hh} = 0$. Suppose we have a causal AR(p) model, $X_{t+h} = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j X_{t+h-j} + W_{t+h}$ and we want to 
calculate $\phi_{hh}$.

The best linear predictor of $X_{t+h}$ is 
\[\hat{X}_{t+h} = \mathbb{E}\left[X_{t+h}|X_t, \dots, X_{t+h-1}\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j X_{t+h-j} + W_{t+h}|X_t, \dots, X_{t+h-1}\right] = \sum_{j=1}^p \mathbb{E}\left[\phi_j X_{t+h-j}|X_t, \dots, X_{t+h-1}\right] = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j X_{t+h-j}.\]
Thus when $h > p$,
\[ \phi_{hh} = corr(X_{t+h} - \hat{X}_{t+h}, X_t - \hat{X}_t) = corr(W_{t+h}, X_t - \hat{X}_t) = 0. \]
```

With these properties in mind, it would be useful to have an estimator for the PACF just as we defined an estimator for the ACF in the previous chapter. If we re-express the above definitions of the PACF $\phi_{hh}$ using the linear predictors and taking from the defintion given earlier followed by its subsequent remark, we can redefine the PACF $\phi_{hh}$ as being the coefficient $\beta_h$ of the linear predictor
\[\hat{X}_{t+h} = \sum_{j=1}^h \beta_j X_{t+h-j}\]
since $\beta_h$ represents the effect of $X_t$ on $X_{t+h}$ once the linear effect of the intermediate variables has been removed. Therefore, given this linear problem, we can obtain an estimate of the PACF ($\hat{\phi}_{hh}$) as the least squares solution for $\beta_h$ to the following regression problem
\[x_{t+h} = \sum_{j=1}^h \beta_j x_{t+h-j},\]
where $(x_t)_{t=h,...,T}$ is the observed time series. Adapting the asymptotics for the coefficients of a linear regression, we have that $\hat{\phi}_{hh}$ is asymptotically normally distributed and, if the process $(X_t)$ is a white noise, its variance is given by
\[\var(\hat{\phi}_{hh}) \approx \frac{1}{T}.\]
Hence, as for the ACF, the PACF can be tested for significance by building approximate confidence intervals using $\pm 2/\sqrt{T}$ as critical limits. Moreover, with such an estimator and confidence intervals, it would be possible to use the information from the estimated ACF and that of the PACF to determine the presence and eventual order of an AR(p) model underlying the observed time series.




### Estimation of AR($p$) models

Given the above defined properties of the AR($p$) models, we will now discuss
how these models can be estimated, more specifically how the $p+1$ parameters 
can be obtained from an observed time series. Indeed, a reliable estimation of 
these models is necessary in order to interpret and describe different natural 
phenomena and/or forecast possible future values of the time series.

A first approach builds upon the earlier definition of the AR(p) as being a
linear process. Recall that
\begin{equation}
    X_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \phi_j X_{t-j} + W_t
\end{equation}
which delivers the following autocovariance function
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(h) = cov(X_{t+h}, X_t) = cov(\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \phi_j X_{t-j} + W_{t+h}, X_t) = \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \phi_j \gamma(h-j), \mbox{ } h \geq 0.
\end{equation}
Rearranging the above expressions we obtain the following general equations
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(h) - \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \phi_j \gamma(h-j) = 0, \mbox{ } h \geq 1
\end{equation}
and, recalling that $\gamma(h) = \gamma(-h)$,
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(0) - \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \phi_j \gamma(j) = \sigma_w^2.
\end{equation}
We can now define the Yule-Walker equations.

```{definition, label = "yweqs", name = "Yule-Walker Equations"}
The Yule-Walker equations are given by
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(h) = \phi_1 \gamma(h-1) + ... + \phi_p \gamma(h-p), \mbox{ } h = 1,...,p
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_w^2 = \gamma(0) - \phi_1 \gamma(1) - ... - \phi_p \gamma(p).
\end{equation}
which in matrix notation can be defined as follows
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_p \mathbf{\phi} = \mathbf{\gamma}_p \text{ and } \sigma_w^2 = \gamma(0) - \mathbf{\phi}'\mathbf{\gamma}_p
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_p$ is the $p\times p$ matrix containing the autocovariances $\gamma(k-j), j,k = 1, ...,p$ while $\mathbf{\phi} = (\phi_1,...,\phi_p)'$ and $\mathbf{\gamma}_p = (\gamma(1),...,\gamma(p))'$ are $p\times 1$ vectors.
```

Considering the Yule-Walker equations, it is possible to use a method of moments
approach and simply replace the theoretical quantities given in the previous
definition with their empirical (estimated) counterparts that we saw in the 
previous chapter. This gives us the following Yule-Walker estimators
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mathbf{\phi}} = \hat{\Gamma}_p^{-1}\hat{\mathbf{\gamma}}_p \text{ and } \hat{\sigma}_w^2 = \hat{\gamma}(0) - \hat{\mathbf{\gamma}}_p'\hat{\Gamma}_p^{-1}\hat{\mathbf{\gamma}}_p
\end{equation}

These estimators have the following asymptotic properties.

**Property: Consistency and Asymptotic Normality of Yule-Walker estimators**
The Yule-Walker estimators for a causal AR(p) model have the following 
asymptotic properties:

\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{T}(\hat{\mathbf{\phi}}- \mathbf{\phi}) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}} \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\sigma_w^2\Gamma_p^{-1}) \text{ and } \hat{\sigma}_w^2 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{P}} \sigma_w^2 .
\end{equation*}

Therefore the Yule-Walker estimators have an asymptotically normal distribution 
and the estimator of the innovation variance is consistent. Moreover, these 
estimators are also optimal for AR(p) models, meaning that they are also
efficient. However, there exists another method which allows to achieve this
efficiency also for general ARMA models and this is the maximum likelihood
method. Considering an AR(1) model as an example, and assuming without loss of
generality that the expectation is zero, we have the following representation
of the AR(1) model
\begin{equation*}
X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + W_t
\end{equation*}
where $|\phi|<1$ and $W_t \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_w^2)$. 
Supposing we have observations issued from this model $(x_t)_{t=1,...,T}$, 
then the likelihood function for this setting is given by
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2) = f(\phi,\sigma_w^2|x_1,...,x_T)
\end{equation*}
which, for an AR(1) model, can be rewritten as follows
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1)f(x_2|x_1)\cdot \cdot \cdot f(x_T|x_{T-1}).
\end{equation*}
If we define $\Omega_t^p$ as the information contained in the previous $p$
observations to time $t$, the above can be generalized for an AR(p) model as
follows
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1,...,x_p)f(x_{p+1}|\Omega_{p+1}^p)\cdot \cdot \cdot f(x_T|\Omega_{T-1}^p)
\end{equation*}
where $f(x_1,...,x_p)$ is the joint probability distribution of the first $p$
observations. A discussion on how to find $f(x_1,...,x_p)$ will be presented in
the following paragraphs based on the approach to find $f(x_1)$ in the AR(1) 
likelihood. Going back to the latter, we know that $x_t|x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\phi x_{t-1},\sigma_w^2)$ and therefore we have that
\begin{equation*}
f(x_t|x_{t-1}) = f_w(x_t - \phi x_{t-1})
\end{equation*}
where $f_w(\cdot)$ is the distribution of $w_t$. This rearranges the likelihood
function as follows
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1)\prod_{t=2}^T f_w(x_t - \phi x_{t-1})
\end{equation*}
where $f(x_1)$ can be found through the causal representation
\begin{equation*}
x_1 = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \phi^j w_{1-j} 
\end{equation*}
which implies that $x_1$ follows a normal distribution with zero expectation and
a variance given by $\frac{\sigma_w^2}{(1-\phi^2)}$. Based on this, the 
likelihood function of an AR(1) finally becomes
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2) = (2\pi \sigma_w^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} (1 - \phi)^2 \exp \left(-\frac{S(\phi)}{2 \sigma_w^2}\right)
\end{equation*}
with $S(\phi) = (1-\phi)^2 x_1^2 + \sum_{t=2}^T (x_t -\phi x_{t-1})^2$. Once the
derivative of the logarithm of the likelihood is taken, the minimization of the 
negative of this function is usually done numerically. However, if we condition 
on the initial values, the AR(p) models are linear and, for example, we can then
define the conditional likelihood of an AR(1) as
\begin{equation*}
L(\phi,\sigma_w^2|x_1) = (2\pi \sigma_w^2)^{-\frac{n-1}{2}} \exp \left(-\frac{S_c(\phi)}{2 \sigma_w^2}\right)
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
S_c(\phi) = \sum_{t=2}^T (x_t -\phi x_{t-1})^2 .
\end{equation*}
The latter is called the conditional sum of squares and $\phi$ can be estimated
as a straightforward linear regression problem. Once an estimate $\hat{\phi}$ is
obtained, this can be used to obtain the conditional maximum likelihood estimate
of $\sigma_w^2$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\sigma}_w^2 = \frac{S_c(\hat{\phi})}{(n-1)} .
\end{equation*}

The estimation methods presented so far are standard ones for these kind of
models. Nevertheless, if the data suffers from some form of contamination, 
these methods can become highly biased. For this reason, some robust estimators
are available to limit this problematic if there are indeed outliers in the 
observed time series. A first solution is given by the estimator proposed in
Kunsch (1984) who underlines that the MLE score function of an AR(p) is 
given by
\begin{equation*}
 \kappa(\mathbf{\theta}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{\theta}} (x_{j+p} - \sum_{k=1}^p \phi_k x_{j+p-k})^2
\end{equation*}
where $\theta$ is the parameter vector containing, in the case of an AR(1)
model, the two parameters $\phi$ and $\sigma_w^2$ 
(i.e.$\theta = [\phi \,\, \sigma_w^2]$). This delivers the estimating equation
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^{n-p} \kappa (\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = 0 .
\end{equation*}
The score function $\kappa(\cdot)$ is clearly not bounded, in the sense that if
we arbitrarily move a value of $(x_t)$ to infinity then the score function also 
goes to infinity thereby delivering a biased estimation procedure. To avoid that
outlying observations bias the estimation excessively, a bounded score function
can be used to deliver an M-estimator given by
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^{n-p} \psi (\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = 0,
\end{equation*}
where $\psi(\cdot)$ is a function of bounded variation. When conditioning on the
first $p$ observations, this problem can be brought back to a linear regression
problem which can be applied in a robust manner using the robust regression
tools available in R such as `rlm(...)` or `lmrob(...)`. However, another 
available tool in R which can applied directly without conditioning also for 
general ARMA models is the `gmwm(...)` function which, by specifying the option
`robust = TRUE`. This function makes use of a quantity called the wavelet 
variance (denoted as $\nu$) which is estimated robustly and then used to 
retrieve the parameters $\theta$ of the time series model. The robust estimate 
is obtained by solving the following minimization problem
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\theta} = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\argmin} (\hat{\nu} - \nu{\theta})^T\Omega(\hat{\nu} - \nu{\theta}),
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{\nu}$ is the robustly estimated wavelet variance, $\nu{\theta}$ is 
the theoretical wavelet variance and $\Omega$ is positive definite weighting 
matrix. Below we show some simulation studies where we present the results of
the above estimation procedures in absence and in presence of contamination in
the data.

INSERT SIMULATIONS

For all the above methods, it would be necessary to understand how "precise" 
their estimates are. To do so we would need to obtain confidence intervals for
these estimates and this can be done mainly in two manners:

- using the asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates;
- using parametric bootstrap.

The first approach consists in using the asymptotic distribution of the 
estimators presented earlier to deliver approximations of the confidence
intervals which get better as the length of the observed time series increases. 
Hence, for example, if we wanted to find a 95% confidence interval for the 
parameter $\phi$, we would use the quantiles of the normal distribution 
(given that all methods presented earlier present this asymptotic distribution).
However, this approach can present some drawbacks, one of which is there
behaviour when the parameters are close to the boundaries of the parameter space. 
Let us take the example of an AR(1) to illustrate this problematic and suppose
that $\phi = 0.99 < 1$ and $\sigma_W^2$. It can be seen that the parameter 
$\phi$ respects the condition for stationarity but is very close to its boundary.
The code below computes the confidence interval for $\phi$ using the asymptotic 
normal distribution.

```{r asy_conf_int, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
```

It can be seen how the confidence interval contains values that make the AR(1) 
non-stationary (i.e. values of $\phi$ larger than 1). For this purpose, 
the approach based on parametric bootstrap provides a viable solution. 
Indeed, parametric bootstrap takes the estimated parameter values and uses 
them in order to simulate from an AR(1) based on these parameter values. For 
each simulation the parameters are estimated again and saved. Finally, the
empirical quantiles of the saved estimated parameter values provide a confidence
interval which does not suffer from boundary problems. The code below gives an 
example of how this confidence interval is built based on the same estimation 
procedure but using parametric bootstrap (using 500 bootstrap replicates).

```{r boot_conf_int, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
```

In this case, it can be observed that the confidence interval lies entirely
within the boundaries of the parameter space.
